# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
- A package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` (or `bun` if you prefer)

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use your preferred package manager to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server using one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

   The page will automatically update as you make edits to the source files.

### Editing the Project

You can start editing the app by modifying the following file:

- `app/page.tsx`

The changes will reflect automatically in the browser.

## Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a font family designed for Vercel.
